# Numerical investigation of airflow nearby people with respect to disease transmission: improving effectiveness of Personal Protective Equipment
With the spread of COVID being argued as predominantly airborne transmission [1], we argue that this transmission vector could be targeted for intervention using manipulation of the fluid dynamics of airflow around people.

By qualifying and quantifying the likely airflow nearby person's faces [2], using Computational Fluid Dynamics [3], we argue that we can compare differing designs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) quickly, thus improving their effectiveness efficiently.

However, due to the non-empirical experimental method employed, certain activities such as validation and verification should be also undertaken to provide confidence numerical experiments (such as CFD) are accurate reflections of the 'real-world'.
